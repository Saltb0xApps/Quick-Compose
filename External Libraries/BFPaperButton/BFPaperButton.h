/** The corner radius which propagates through to the sub layers. */

/** A flag to set to YES to use Smart Color, or NO to use a custom color scheme. While Smart Color is the default (usesSmartColor = YES), customization is cool too. */

/** The UIColor to use for the circle which appears where you tap. NOTE: Setting this defeats the "Smart Color" ability of the tap circle. Alpha values less than 1 are recommended. */
@property UIColor *tapCircleColor;

/** The UIColor to fade clear backgrounds to. NOTE: Setting this defeats the "Smart Color" ability of the background fade. An alpha value of 1 is recommended, as the fade is a constant (clearBGFadeConstant) defined in the BFPaperButton.m. This bothers me too. */
@property UIColor *backgroundFadeColor;

/** The CGFloat value representing the Diameter of the tap-circle. By default it will be the result of MAX(self.frame.width, self.frame.height). Any value less than zero will result in default being used. The constants: tapCircleDiameterLarge, tapCircleDiameterMedium, and tapCircleDiameterSmall are also available for use. */

/** A flag to set to YES to have the tap-circle ripple from point of touch. If this is set to NO, the tap-circle will always ripple from the center of the button. Default is YES. */

/** A flag to set to YES to CHANGE a flat button to raised, or set to NO to CHANGE a raised button to flat. If you used one of the provided custom initializers, you should probably leave this parameter alone. If you instantiated via storyboard or IB and want to change from riased to flat, this is the parameter for you! */

@property (nonatomic) UIFont *titleFont UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR;



/* Notes on RAISED vs FLAT and SMART COLOR vs NON SMART COLOR:
 *
 * RAISED
 *  Has a shadow, so a clear background will look silly.
 *  It has only a tap-circle color. No background-fade.
 *
 * FLAT
 *  Has no shadow, therefore clear backgrounds look fine.
 *  If the background is clear, it also has a background-fade
 *  color to help visualize the button and its frame.
 *
 * SMART COLOR
 *  Will use the titleLabel's font color to pick
 *  a tap circle color and, if the background is clear, will
 *  also pick a lighter background fade color.
 *
 * NON SMART COLOR
 *  Will use a translucent gray tap-circle
 *  and, if the background is clear, a lighter translucent
 *  graybackground-fade color.
